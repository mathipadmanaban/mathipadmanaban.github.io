    <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a deep passion for science, engineering and problem-solving. My journey as an international scholar and first-generation graduate has shaped my unique approach to research, bringing diverse perspectives to engineering solutions. Beyond the lab, I'm a mother of two young boys, balancing the excitement of research innovation with the joy of raising curious minds. :) </p>
