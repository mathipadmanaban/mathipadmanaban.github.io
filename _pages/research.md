<p>My research develops <strong>geometry-informed computer vision</strong> and <strong>machine learning methods</strong> for reliable perception and decision support in safety-critical applications. My dissertation work addresses transportation safety through two complementary tracks: data-driven behavioral modeling and geometry-informed computer vision, providing experience with both paradigms and their limitations.</p>

  <h2>Current Research</h2>
  <div class="research-title">Fine-Grained Vehicle Type Analysis for Cyclist Overtaking Behavior</div>
  <div class="research-desc">Current and final phase of doctoral work integrating geometry-informed computer vision components to investigate how fine-grained vehicle types (e.g., SUVs vs. sedans) systematically influence overtaking behavior. This research builds on geometry-based passing distance estimation (MAE 9.5 cm) and overtaking detection systems to provide comprehensive analysis of cyclist-vehicle interactions.</div>
