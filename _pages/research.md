  <h2>Current Research</h2>
  <div class="research-title">Smart Detection of Vehicle Overtaking Maneuvers for Cycling Safety</div>
  <div class="research-desc">Developing a deep learning-based computer vision system for automated detection of vehicle overtaking events using data from specialized research bicycle. The system leverages advanced computer vision object detection and tracking algorithms to identify and track vehicles, while employing geometric angle analysis to validate genuine overtaking maneuvers. The project includes real-time visualization capabilities and comprehensive event logging, contributing to the further down-stream applications on understanding of vehicle-cyclist interactions in urban environments.</div>

  <div class="project-item">
    <div class="project-title">A Machine Learning Approach to Identify Aggressive Driving Patterns based on Vehicle Longitudinal Jerk</div>
    <div class="project-desc">This research develops a machine learning approach to predict aggressive driving behaviors using vehicle jerk metrics from real-world data. We evaluated three jerk metrics and introduced a novel speed-adjusted jerk threshold method. Using a customized machine learning pipeline testing among multiple regression models, we achieved over 93% prediction accuracy finding a better model and feature set to predict aggressive driving from vehicle jerk metrics. The study's findings have significant implications for real-time driver behavior monitoring, fuel efficiency improvement, and various transportation safety applications including crash-warning systems and autonomous vehicles.</div>

    <div class="project-title">A Comparative Analysis of Acceleration and Deceleration Profiles for Aggressive Driving Styles and Fuel Economy Test Cycles</div>
    <div class="project-desc">This research investigates the relationship between driving behavior patterns and environmental impact using real-world driving data and EPA Fuel Economy cycles. By analyzing acceleration profiles of aggressive versus non-aggressive driving, we demonstrated significant differences in fuel economy and environmental impact. The study's findings contribute to developing sustainable driving practices and evidence-based transportation policies.</div>

  <h2>Master's Thesis</h2>
  <div class="project-item">
    <div class="project-title">Computational Human Performance Modeling using Queuing Network in an Open-Source Platform</div>
    <div class="project-desc">This research implements an open-source version of the QN-MHP cognitive architecture using Python and SimPy for computational UI testing. The model simulates human cognition as a queuing network of information processors, providing designers a cost-effective tool to evaluate UI designs without extensive human subject testing. Model validation using visual-manual tasks demonstrated alignment with empirical data, making it a valuable resource for the computational human modeling community.</div>

  <div class="project-item">
    <div class="project-title">Intelligent Vehicle Lane Change System</div>
    <div class="project-desc">This research develops an intelligent lane change prediction system for autonomous vehicles using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). Using real-world vehicle trajectory data from the NGSIM dataset, I created a robust deep learning model that achieved 98.66% accuracy in predicting lane change behaviors. The system's high performance and quick computational time make it particularly valuable for improving autonomous vehicle decision-making and safety in complex road scenarios.</div>

    <div class="project-title">Mixed Methods Study on Data Privacy in Messenger Applications: A Comparison between WhatsApp and Signal</div>
    <div class="project-desc">This research explores user perceptions of data privacy in messaging applications, focusing on the balance between privacy, trust, and usability. Through a mixed-methods study comparing WhatsApp and Signal, we analyzed user attitudes toward data collection and privacy policies. Our findings revealed users' strong preference for transparency in data collection and aggregate data usage over personal data collection. The study highlights the growing importance of data privacy in user trust and messaging app selection.</div>
